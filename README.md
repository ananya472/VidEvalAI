In todayâ€™s digital learning and interview-based environment, students and job seekers often need to record video responses or give virtual interviews. But evaluating these responses manually is:
Time-consuming

Subjective (different people may give different scores)

Difficult to scale when there are many candidates or students

Teachers, recruiters, and mentors struggle to assess all aspects of a personâ€™s communicationâ€”like how well they speak, how confident they sound, whether their answers make sense, and how close their answer is to the correct one.


This is where EvalynAI comes in.
EvalynAI is a smart AI-powered evaluation tool that analyzes spoken answers from videos. It gives automatic feedback on the following:
âœ… Grammar â€“ Checks how correct the language is

ðŸŽ¯ Explanation Relevance â€“ Compares the userâ€™s answer with an ideal one to see how similar they are

ðŸ’¬ Coherence â€“ Judges if the answer makes logical and meaningful sense

ðŸ˜Š Emotion â€“ Detects the speakerâ€™s emotion (e.g., confident, sad, happy, nervous)
